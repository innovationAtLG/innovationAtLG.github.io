            <p>The Future Experience (FX) team at LG works on new Product Discovery. We leverage our deep expertise in AI, embedded devices, and Service Platforms take on high-risk bets that can meaningfully change lives at LG&rsquo;s global scale.  </p>
<p>At any time, we might be exploring ideas in a host of markets serviced by LG Electronics.
Our team&rsquo;s core focus is on Smart - Retail, Mobility, personal electronics, and Home.
While we have the expertise and resources of LG to support the projects, each project still has to overcome two primary risks faced by every entrepreneurial effort.  </p>
<p>Many people have the misconception that entrepreneurism is about taking risks. However, if you talk to seasoned entrepreneurs, you will learn that they are risk-reducing machines.
At FX, we tap into that entrepreneurial spirit to manage the risks of new projects that we take on.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-risks-production-risk-and-value-risk">The Two Risks: Production Risk and Value Risk</h3>
<p>Risk breaks down into many categories. The two fundamental ones that all entrepreneurs need to consider are Production Risk and Value Risk, sometimes called Technical Risk and Business Risk.  Said plainly,  &ldquo;Can I build it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;If I build it, will someone buy it?&rdquo; </p>
<p>If we plot Production Risk  vs Business Risk on graph - All projects start on the top right. As Jim Barksdale, a Silicon Valley legend and the former CEO of Netscape, says &ldquo;everything looks like a snake at first.&rdquo; <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/dont-play-with-dead-snakes-and-other-management-advice">Source</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/bPost5_Img-1.jpg" alt="Two by Two Production and Value Risk"></p>
<h3 id="hypotheses--experiments-expand-the-threshold-of-knowledge">Hypotheses + Experiments Expand the Threshold of Knowledge</h3>
<p>As the Team talks to customers, market experts, creates hypotheses and runs experiments or builds rapid prototypes  they gain more clarity on what to build and how to build it. Each experiment and action creates new  information that pushes the threshold of knowledge. </p>
<p>Each step of knowledge drives the risk down, to the left or along both axes of the graph. For example, if your idea is that we should build a rocket to launch satellites into low earth orbit for a lower price than current providers.  You could reduce Value risk (i.e., move down on the graph) by finding ten customers who will engage your services if you can provide it.  On the other hand,  building small-scale rockets to validate a new engine designs and ensure we can launch reduces production risk.
 
<img src="/images/blog/bPost5_Img-2.jpg" alt="Reducing Project Risk"></p>
<h3 id="project-categories-by-type-and-level-of-risk">Project Categories by Type and Level of Risk</h3>
<p>While every project starts to the top right -  We can also leverage this framework to categorize the risks of different projects.  Projects all the way in the top right projects are moonshots - we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll work and we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s valuable until we build a chunk of it.  </p>
<p>A project in the bottom right quadrant means we&rsquo;ve learned that there is a clear market need, but there is a very high Technical Risk in realizing that product. For many startups and for the Future Experiences team this is our sweet spot.  If your project starts or lingers in the bottom left where the Business Risk and Technical Risks are are very low you&rsquo;re likely building a commodity product with high competition.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/bPost5_Img-3.jpg" alt="Four Risk Quadrants"></p>
<p>The trickiest spot on the map is the top left.  This is a the classic startup trap. We&rsquo;ve reduced the technical risk - we know what code to write, we know what to design, we know exactly how to build it. But we have no idea if what we&rsquo;re building is something that people want.  </p>
<p>Usually, teams get trapped here because they didn&rsquo;t spend enough time outside the building talking to their potential customers and deeply learning the user and customer problems.. This trap is so common place that that Paul Graham the founder of YC the most successful early stage incubator - made &ldquo;Make something the people want&rdquo; their motto. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator">Source</a></p>
<h3 id="how-we-deal-with-risk-at-fx">How we deal with Risk at FX</h3>
<p>At FX, we love projects in the Bottom Right or ones that we can move into the bottom right corner. If we can solve the hard technical problem, we know that we have a market for it.   We utilize a structured method called the FX process that first identifies the key boundary conditions for any project - Market, Segment, Known opportunities and challenges - this is Phase 0. </p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/bPost5_Img-4.jpg" alt="FX Process"></p>
<p>From there we systematically reduce both business and technical risk in a staged manner. Phase 1 validates the problem, and it&rsquo;s importance to real customers. This is done well before we conceptualize a solution or a &ldquo;cool thing to build&rdquo; in Phase 1.   </p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/bPost5_Img-5.jpg" alt="FX Process"></p>
<p>The proposed solution itself is then validated with real customers. This is done before building out a PoC which reduces technical risk. Ultimately, these actions give us high confidence that we&rsquo;ve reduce Business and Technical risks by the time we get to a Pilot for B2B or to a Beta for B2C ventures.</p>
<p>Each step in the FX process reduces technical risk, business risk, or both. By focusing on value risk before the technical risk reduction we know that when we start writing code it&rsquo;s going to have a meaningful impact on the team. </p>
<p>This is a small glimpse into some of organizational innovation that we&rsquo;re leading at LG Electronics in the Future Experiences team. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning about the FX process joining us as a designer, engineer, product manager, a pilot customer, or design partner - I would love to hear from you - <a href="mailto:sandeep.chivukula@lge.com">sandeep.chivukula@lge.com</a></p>
