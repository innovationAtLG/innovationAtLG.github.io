We are living in unprecedented times. The new Coronavirus has turned our world upside down, forcing millions of people to work from home instead of the office. From Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft to Chevron, AT&T, and Spotify, the list of companies embracing remote working kept growing and growing.

During this COVID 19 lockdown, many people are finding remote working to be new, difficult, and perhaps a little overwhelming. Some might be working alongside their kids while trying to simultaneously feed them snacks and lunch and help them with their homework. Others might have discovered that their homes are not suitable working spaces, or their homes are not arranged in a way that allows both them and their spouses to comfortably work. Working remotely under these circumstances means adapting new tools, battling a new set of distractions as well as experiencing an unprecedented fusion of work and private life.

At LG FX, it is the people who define our Team. Being fully remote doesn’t change that fundamental philosophy. If anything, it strengthens our team by challenging us to constantly innovate how we motivate ourselves and each other, how we learn, and how we have fun as a team. For that, we created what we call "FXDO the Art of Having Fun". The goal was and still is respecting and supporting each other with our personal time while motivating and challenging us through foundational design thinking processes with friends and family, and in our daily routine. For that our workday becomes very simple: forget about work and focus on having fun. For example, how do I help my baby so she stops crying? How do I help my son with his homework while helping my daughter with her dance class too... all without being a teacher or dance instructor? The result: sharing our personal experiences with each other, having a good laugh together, and getting to know each other even more.
